# OT_cost
The directory is organized by analysis type. The main two analysis presented in the paper can be found in 'OTCost' and 'run_models'. The former has workbooks showing how the datasets at different costs were generated. The latter has the code to train the different models. Note, the directory helper has code that is reused across many tasks. The other directories include code for the supplementary analysis of the paper. Note, if you wish to run the code, please add the ROOT_DIR variable to all scripts so they can run.
